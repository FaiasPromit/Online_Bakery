Assignment Details - 
1. First assignment - Assignment on Fibonacci Sequence - C file uploaded in 1707116-1.c file.
2. Second assignment - Assignment on ls Command - C file uploaded in 1707116-2.c file. The compile file is generated using 
the "gcc 1707116-2.c" command. Then the compile file has been renamed to "myls" and moved to the bin file. The bin file was 
accessed in the first place using the "sudo -i" command . The command to move the compile file was - "cp './home/faias/Desktop/
Assignment/myls' './bin' ". So now, the file can run using the command "myls -l" / "myls -a" / "myls -t" . No external command
"./myls" command is needed. Also, no ".l" is needed.
